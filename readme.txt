this is an advanced car rent simulation (at least if you adjust prices and salaries) . When you start you need to pick up a company name or just enter for automatic name. Then you need to select how many cars you will have in your garage and workers at the beginning. Remember you have a fixed capital and more cars means more cost for you. 
simulation starts 01.01.2023 and you can pass a day by choosing "pass a day", time to time customer will come randomly and rent cars from your garage. When rent time is over, the car will automatically return to garage. you can choose "automatic day pass" for automation and see your profit and loss.
in every month, you pay rent, workers salary, every year, workers salary will increase %10 and building rent %5. 

in order to run program all modules should be in same directory.

Issues: car prices, models, rent prices are NOT REALISTIC. it means , you need to enter some realistic prices to get better results. I should also mention all cars have daily cost and it will subtract from your main capital. Even if company capital will be under zero, program will run, to make it realistic, company should stop if total capital is under zero. 
in menu, you can see graphical representation of your company income and loss. you can reset the graphic as well. 
you can sell cars and change your workers. for me it was a challenge to write "automatic car return function" program uses a real time calender.  
another matter is also with salaries. Workers salaries should adjust again. You can refer the prices and salaries in your own country. 
have fun
